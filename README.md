Here's how you can set environment variables in a Rails application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your Rails application's root directory.

3. Run the following command to set the environment variables:

export CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>

export CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>

Replace <your_client_id> and <your_client_secret> with the actual values for your client ID and client secret.

Note: The syntax for setting environment variables can vary depending on your operating system. The above command works for Unix-based systems like macOS and Linux. If you're using Windows, the command might be different. Consult the documentation for your specific operating system.
